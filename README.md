**Facial Expressions Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

This project aims to recognize facial expressions from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It employs deep learning techniques to accurately detect and classify emotions expressed through facial features.

### Introduction

Recognizing facial expressions plays a crucial role in various fields such as human-computer interaction, affective computing, and psychology. With advancements in deep learning, specifically CNNs, it's possible to achieve high accuracy in facial expression recognition tasks.

### Features

- Utilizes CNNs for robust feature extraction from facial images.
- Supports recognition of multiple facial expressions including happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, fearful, and neutral.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for image input and emotion output.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Artxo24/facial-expressions-cnn.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd facial-expressions-cnn
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your facial images for input. Ensure they are clear and properly cropped to focus on the face.

2. Run the program:
   ```
   python facial_expression_recognition.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your image and view the predicted facial expression.

### Model Training (Optional)

If you wish to train the model with custom data:

1. Prepare your dataset with labeled facial expressions.

2. Modify the training script to load your dataset and configure parameters as needed.

3. Train the model.
